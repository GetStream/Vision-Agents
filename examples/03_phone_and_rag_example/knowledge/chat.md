## Important for some customers

* Custom attachments enable you to integrate any aspect of your app into the chat. Strava allows you to share routes. Marketplace apps show your trade/ or booking overview etc
* Moderation. Stream offers integrated and cost effective moderation. This is most important for apps that are dealing with user generated content. Its less of a concern in b2b apps where people pay
* Teams. For b2b apps stream offers the concept of teams. this makes it easy to split the access of the chat for each of the customer's customers.
