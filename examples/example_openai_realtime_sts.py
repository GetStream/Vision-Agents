OpenAI Realtime Speech-to-Speech Example for Stream Agents

This example demonstrates how to use the Agent class with OpenAI's real-time
voice API (STS - Speech-to-Speech) for natural conversation in a Stream video call.

Key Features:
- Real-time speech-to-speech communication using OpenAI's Realtime API
- No separate STT/TTS services needed - everything is handled by OpenAI
- Natural conversation flow with interruption support
- Tool calling capabilities
- Configurable voice and instructions

Usage:
    python example_openai_realtime_sts.py

The example will:
1. Create a Stream video call
2. Join as an AI Agent using OpenAI Realtime STS
3. Handle real-time voice conversations
4. Demonstrate tool calling (start closed captions)
5. Provide natural, interruption-capable conversation

Requirements:
    - STREAM_API_KEY and STREAM_SECRET environment variables
    - OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
    - getstream-python package with openai-realtime support
    - stream-agents package
