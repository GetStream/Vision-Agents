never mock. 
tests use pytest. 
never adjust sys.path.

docs should be short.
docstrings should follow the google style guides for docstrings.

integration tests use
@pytest.mark.integration

@pytest.mark.asyncio is not needed (its automatic)

we use uv on this project, no python -m non-sense please. If you get in trouble with deps just stop and ask, better to have the human resolve things (no sudo brew kind of stuff please)
