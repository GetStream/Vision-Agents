      instructions: |
        Review the following unit test code written using the pytest test library. Ensure that:
        - The code adheres to best practices associated with Pytest. The project uses uv.  
        - Descriptive test names are used to clearly convey the intent of each test.
        - For Integration tests, we should avoid mocking. Integration tests of classes should use the actual client. 
        - The test should convey actual value. Tests which initialise a class and test the values of those classes should be discouraged 
        - Discourage verbosity and redundant tests
